Multiphase Flow Using VOF (Water–Air Interface)
Advanced CFD Simulation – ANSYS Fluent

This page showcases an advanced CFD project using the Volume of Fluid (VOF) model to simulate water–air interface behavior. It demonstrates the type of high-quality analysis, guidance, and tutorials I provide for engineering students, researchers, and professionals working with multiphase flows.

🌊 Project Overview

VOF simulations are essential for:

Free-surface flows

Sloshing tanks & ship motion

Pouring & filling processes

Spillways & channel flows

Wave interaction studies

This demonstration highlights accurate modeling of interface formation, surface tension, gravity effects, and transient fluid behaviour.

🎥 Visual Outputs

(You can upload your animations, images, and simulation snippets here)

Examples you may include:

Water–air interface motion animation

Volume fraction contours

Velocity vectors and streamlines

Free-surface shape evolution

These visuals help clients understand the depth and accuracy of the simulation work you provide.

💡 What You Will Learn (If You Take the Tutorial / Course)

This project is designed to teach you:

How to configure VOF multiphase models

Setting up realistic water–air interface conditions

Choosing correct mesh size for free surface

Applying transient settings for smooth interface tracking
